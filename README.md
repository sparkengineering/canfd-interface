ToDo:
- [ ] Little less LEDs,
      maybe only state/activity like in cannectivity?
      (+ error would be cool)
- [ ] Boot LED as GPIO
- [ ] Add GPIO termination
- [ ] Implement ktd202x driver
- [ ] CAN high/low silkscreen on the pins
- [ ] Acrylic top plate
- [ ] Check if there is a cool dual-channel transceiver in one package
